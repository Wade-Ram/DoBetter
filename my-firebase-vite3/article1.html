  <h1 class="H1-article">DoBetter's Origin</h1>
    <img src="image/DoBetter01.jpg" alt="Origin of DoBetter">
  <p>Once in classrooms all over South Africa, students were struggling quietly. 
    Some were afraid to raise their hands in class, some didn’t have all the textbooks, and others just needed a little extra help after school.
    But no matter how hard they tried, they always felt like something was missing.
     That’s when DoBetter was born.</p>
  <p>It wasn’t just another website with notes. It was created with one simple belief:
     Every student deserves the chance to learn, grow, and succeed — anytime, anywhere.
     On DoBetter, a student who once failed Math could find clear explanations, step-by-step resources, and practice that finally made sense.
    A learner who hated Geography could discover fun, easy-to-understand notes and actually start to enjoy it.</p>
  <p> A shy student who never spoke in class could quietly download resources, practice at home, and walk back into school with confidence.
     It became more than just a website.</p>
    <p> It became a friend in your pocket — the one that always had your back before an exam, during homework, or when teachers moved too fast in class.
     And slowly, those students stopped doubting themselves. Their marks went up. Their confidence grew. They stopped saying, <strong>“I can’t,” and started saying, I’ll try.</strong>
    Because with DoBetter, no one studies alone.</p>
